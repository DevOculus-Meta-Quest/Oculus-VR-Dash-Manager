Oculus VR Dash Manager<br>
<br>
I love the Oculuskiller but as a person who owns both Oculus and Steam title I wanted a way to switch between on my PC and while wearing the headset.<br>
So I created: https://github.com/KrisIsBackAU/Oculus-VR-Dash-Manager<br>
<br>
You can change which dash you want before putting on the headset or even while wearing the headset.<br>
    *** SteamVR is VERY odd with Admin Programs (Hover for 5 Seconds) has been added to solve that.<br>
    *** Top Most is recommended and is default on as Focusing a Admin Program is also VERY odd in SteamVR<br><br>
To access the program while wearing the headset, you will need to View your Desktop via Oculus Dash or SteamVR, when not wearing the headset access it like any other program.<br>
<br>
Supports:<br>
- Official Dash updates (To be improved)<br>
- Installing & Updating Oculus Killer  (https://github.com/ItsKaitlyn03/OculusKiller)  (To be improved)<br>
- Switching between the dash boards while wearing headset<br>
- Ability to exit SteamVR when using Oculus Killer and return to Quest Home<br>
<br><br>
!!! MUST RUN Oculus VR Dash Manager.exe AS ADMIN !!!<br>
Oculus Directory & Oculus Services & SteamVR access needs Admin<br>
<br>
If you only want to use SteamVR you can run the program, let it install Oculus Killer and then click the corresponding button to switch and that's it you do not need to run my program every time.<br>
<br>
Hope this tool helps others enjoy the performance that Oculus Killer gives while making it easy to flip between the dashes as needed.<br>
<br>
This program has not been tested on many machines and is a my first public release of software.<br>
You will also need to install .Net Core Desktop Apps. When attempting to run the program will you be promoted to do so, please select the Desktop App Version. (May change this in future)<br>
